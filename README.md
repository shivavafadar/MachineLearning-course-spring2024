This was the masters degree course from University of Tehran's College of Engineering

*hw1*: 
+ implementing Linear Regression on 'boston' dataset with 'Mini-Batch Gradient Descent' learning and 'Mean Squared Error' as error function with and without using SKlearn library. Using L2-norm regularization. 
+ impelemntation of Logistic regression on 'breast-cancer' dataset both with and without SKlearn library. using L2-norm

*hw2*: 
+ implementation of 'iris' dataset with QDA & LDA method.
+ implementation of 'https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stat/data/poisson_sim.csv' dataset and predicting the models parameters and showing the prediction graph.

*hw3*: 
+ implementation of 'mnist' dataset classification using neural networks. using sigmoid function as hidden layer, softmax function as output layer and cross entropy for error calculation.  + implementing feed-forward and back-propagation both with and without tensorflow library.

*hw4*: 
+ computation of prediction accuracy of hw3, calculation of precision, recall and F measure, ploting ROC graph for each class using SKlearn.
+ implementing PCA algorithm on it.

*final project*:
+ Research article Prediction of bitcoin stock price using feature subset optimization
+ **Bitcoin Time Series Forecasting**

Bitcoin is the longest running and most well known cryptocurrency, first released as open source in 2009 by the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin serves as a decentralized medium of digital exchange, with transactions verified and recorded in a public distributed ledger (the blockchain) without the need for a trusted record keeping authority or central intermediary. Transaction blocks contain a SHA-256 cryptographic hash of previous transaction blocks, and are thus "chained" together, serving as an immutable record of all transactions that have ever occurred. As with any currency/commodity on the market, bitcoin trading and financial instruments soon followed public adoption of bitcoin and continue to grow.
