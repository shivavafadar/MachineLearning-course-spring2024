This was the masters degree course from University of Tehran's College of Engineering

*hw1*: implementing Linear Regression on 'boston' dataset with 'Mini-Batch Gradient Descent' learning and 'Mean Squared Error' as error function with and without using SKlearn library. Using L2-norm regularization. 
impelemntation of Logistic regression on 'breast-cancer' dataset both with and without SKlearn library. using L2-norm

*hw2*: implementation of 'iris' dataset with QDA & LDA method.
implementation of 'https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stat/data/poisson_sim.csv' dataset and predicting the models parameters and showing the prediction graph.

*hw3*: implementation of 'mnist' dataset classification using neural networks. using sigmoid function as hidden layer, softmax function as output layer and cross entropy for error calculation. implementing feed-forward and back-propagation both with and without tensorflow library.

*hw4*: computation of prediction accuracy of hw3, calculation of precision, recall and F measure, ploting ROC graph for each class using SKlearn.
+ implementing PCA algorithm on it.
